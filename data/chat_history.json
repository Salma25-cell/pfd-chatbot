They are surrounded by angle brackets (< and >), and normally come in pairs like <b> and </b>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag. The text between the start and end tags is the element content.\n\nIn HTML, there are both logical tags and physical tags. Logical tags are designed to describe the enclosed text's meaning, while physical tags are used to define the layout and appearance of the HTML elements.\n\nSome key points about HTML tags are:\n\n- HTML tags are not case sensitive, <b> means the same as <B>.\n- When you enclose an element in multiple tags, the last tag opened should be the first tag closed.\n- Tags can have attributes, which provide additional information about the HTML elements on the page.\n- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase tags in their HTML 4 recommendation, and XHTML requires lowercase tags.\n\nExamples of HTML tags include:\n\n- <b> to define bold text\n- <strong> to define strong importance\n- <body> to define the HTML element that contains the body of the HTML document\n- <html> to define the root element of an HTML document\n- <head> to define the metadata of an HTML document\n- <title> to define the title of an HTML document", "source_docs": ["When you enclose an element in with  multiple tags, the last tag opened  should be the first tag closed. \nFor example: \n \n<p><b><em> This is NOT the proper way to close nested tags .</p></em></b>\n \n<p><b><em> This is the proper way to close nested tags.  </em></b></p>\nNote:  It doesn't matter which tag is first, but they must be closed in the proper order.  \nWhy Use Lowercase Tags?  \nYou may notice we've used lowercase tags even though  I said that HTML tags are not case sensitive. \n<B> means the same as <b>. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the group responsible for \ndeveloping web standards, recommends lowercase tags in their HTML 4 recommendation, and XHTML \n(the next generation HTML) requires lowercase tags. \n \nTag Attributes  \nTags can have attributes. Attributes can provide a dditional information abou t the HTML elements on \nyour page. The <tag>  tells the browser to do something, while  the attribute tells the browser how to", "open a window that shows you the actual HTML of the page.

Logical tags are designed to describe (to the \nbrowser) the enclosed text's meaning.  An example of a logical tag is the <strong> </strong>  tag. By \nplacing text in between these tags you are telli ng the browser that the text has some greater \nimportance. By default all browsers make th e text appear bold when in between the <strong>  and", "<html>  \n<head>  \n<title>My First Webpage</title>  \n</head>  \n<body>  \nThis is my first homepage. <b>This text is bold</b>  \n</body>  \n</html> \n \nThis is an HTML element: \n \n<b>This text is bold </b>  \n \nThe HTML element begins with a start tag: <b>\nThe content of the HTML elem ent is: This text is bold \nThe HTML element ends  with an end tag: </b>\n \nThe purpose of the <b> tag is to define an HTML element that should be displayed as bold. \n \nThis is also an HTML element: \n \n<body>  \nThis is my first homepage. <b> This text is bold </b>  \n</body>\n \nThis HTML element starts with the start tag < body>,  and ends with the end tag </body> . The purpose \nof the <body>  tag is to define the HTML element that contains the body of the HTML document. \n \nNested Tags  \nYou may have noticed in the example above, the <body>  tag also contains other tags, like the <b> tab. \nWhen you enclose an element in with  multiple tags, the last tag opened  should be the first tag closed. \nFor example:"]}, {"role": "user", "content": "variable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A variable in Python is defined with the assignment operator (=) and can be assigned a value without declaring its type.
